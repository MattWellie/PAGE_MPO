MP:0001697 - any anomaly in the proportions of embryo compared to littermates (sensu Mus: up to E14, or the completion of organogenesis): 12
MP:0001700 - atypical axial rotation of the germ layers of the embryo during the primitive streak/early somite stage during which the curvature of the entire trunk region is normally reversed and the neural ectoderm moves to the convex region and the midgut region becomes located in the concave region: 1
MP:0001722 - bloodless yolk sac: 3
MP:0003720 - any anomaly in the last step in the formation of the neural tube, where the paired neural folds are brought together and fuse at the dorsal midline: 3
MP:0003984 - slow or limited development during the embryonic period (sensu Mus: up to E14, or the completion of organogenesis): 1
MP:0004258 - anomaly in the size or shape of the organ of metabolic interchange between fetus and mother: 1
MP:0005650 - any structural anomaly of the mesenchymal outgrowth on the lateral trunk of the embryo that develops into the limbs: 3
MP:0011100 - death of all organisms of a given genotype in a population between fertilization and weaning age (Mus: approximately 3-4 weeks of age): 444
MP:0011110 - the appearance of lower than Mendelian ratios of organisms of a given genotype due to death of some, but not all of the organisms between fertilization and weaning age (Mus: approximately 3-4 weeks of age): 196
